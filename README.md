# Scraping from Ebay
 #### Web scraping Ebay for items of choice and storing data in a json file. <br />
 For this specific example I scraped Ebay for "airpods" as shown in the ```searchItem``` variable. Consequently, to search for a different item I would just change the value of ```searchItem``` variable. <br />
 The algorithm extracts the title, the price and the status of every item posted at top 10 pages on Ebay and then stores those values in a dictionary for every item. [items.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohorban/web-scraping/main/items.json?token=AQXOAEQ5IKKNEKRNHK4IAT27VIOIG) file contains the list of all dictionaries. <br />
